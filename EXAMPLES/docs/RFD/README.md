## 4. Modular Index
<!-- 
    The RFD is split into focused files to ensure technical reviews 
    remain deep and productive. 
-->
1. [**Structure & Dependencies**](./01_structure.md): Layout and external libraries.
2. [**Data Model**](./02_data_model.md): Storage, schemas, and integrity.
3. [**Interface Design**](./03_interface.md): Communication contracts (API/Web).
4. [**Logic & Services**](./04_logic.md): Business rules and service signatures.
5. [**Ops & Security**](./05_ops_and_security.md): Testing, deployment, and secrets.

*Maintenance Note: Any change to a sub-file requires the 'Current State' here to be set to 'Proposed' in the PR, and flipped to 'Accepted' upon merge.*
